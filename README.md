This is a fun (not that fun for me, currently) project that explores different ways to print "I love you" in Go. I chose the number 100 because it stops at 99 when counting from 0, and 99 is forever in Chinese culture.

Hopefully, this project reminds all of us how precious our loved ones are. As nerdy as it sounds, I'm planning on using this project as one of the gifts for a very special person in my life who I have ignored, mistreated, and hurt. No word can describe my regret.

Before you fork and contribute anything, and no matter how busy you are (trust me, I've been there), look away from your screen, turn to that special person in your life, and tell them how much you love them. Take the time to show your love, support, and understanding.

Life is short, and tomorrow is not promised. Never waste the opportunity to tell someone you love them.
